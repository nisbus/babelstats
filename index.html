        <h3>Welcome to Babelstats.</h3>

<p>The Babelstats application is useful for serving data from a database through a restful interface.
   It has other features too :)</p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p>All numerical data can be treated as a time-series (static data will just have one date).
   All numerical data can be categorized using 6 dimensions (6 degrees of separation).
</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>To start using Babelstats you need to have 3 things installed on your machine:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://github.com/nisbus/babelstats">Babelstats</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> (You can use a hosted solution like cloudant)</li>
    <li><a href="nginx.org">nginx</a> (if you host both babelstats and couchdb on the same machine)  
        See the nginx.config in the babelstats repository</li>
  </ul>
  After you have setup all the necessary things you will need to get the couchapps into couchdb.</br>
  There are several ways to do that (couchapp, kanso, erica).</br></br>
  Now that the database is prepped and your server is running you need some documents in the database.</br>
  Take a look at the document_creator.erl which creates some sample documents. You might want to change something in there like the categories and titles if you like, or even start with real data.</br>
  After your data is in couchdb you should be able to browse to <a href="http://localhost/babelstat/index.html">http://localhost/babelstat/index.html</a> and see the interface for charting data from the database.</br>
  The GUI is very crude and only meant for demonstration purposes. 
</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
  When dealing with a lot of statistical data from different sources, comparisons get quite hairy.
  Imagine getting the GDP (Gross domestic product) of all the countries in the world into a single database.</br>
  All of the numbers are specified in the local currency of the country and the scale of the economy (billions, millions etc.)</br>
  How do you compare them on a graph?</br>
  Babelstats lets you put the data in to the database as the source specifies it, you only need to let it know a few metrics of each datapoint.
  <ul>
    <li>Metric: The metric can be a currency, temerature, measurement (km, miles etc)</li>
    <li>Scale: The scale is a multiplier of one unit of metric</li>
    <li>Frequency: This can be hourly, daily etc. and is used to aggregate lower frequency data when comparing with higher frequency data.</li>
  </ul>
  Example:
   US GDP:  Metric=USD, Scale=1000000,Frequency=monthly.</br>
  When you query Babelstats you can give it the metrics you want the result to be and it will convert the data for you before returning.</br>
  </br>
  Another powerful feature are the calculated series.</br>
  A lot of statistical information is derived from base statistics i.e. GDP per capita is the Gross Domestic Product divided by the population of a country.</br>
  Imagine not having to store all this derived data but calculate it when requested.</br>
  A calculated series in Babelstats is a single document that defines the calculation as a string of document queries and mathematical operators.</br>
</br>
  Example (GDP per capita):
    {Countries,USA,Economy,Total,Key Statistics,GDP}/{Countries,USA,Census,Total,Population,All}
</br></br>    
  When you call this series, Babelstats will call the database requesting both of those series and divide one with the other for each series point it finds.</br>
  There is no limit as to the recursiveness of the calculations, that is if one of the series in a calculation is a calculation itself it will traverse the database
  until it gets to the source and then calculate upwards towards the result.</br>
  Of course metrics play a key role here in converting all parts of the calculation to a common logical metric.
